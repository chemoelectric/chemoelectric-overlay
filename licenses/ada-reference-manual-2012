Source: There are two layers of upstream; the formal Ada standard at
 http://www.ada-auth.org/arm.html, and the intermediate package in
 monotone at mtn://www.ada-france.org?org.adaic.arm_form (also at
 http://www.stephe-leake.org/ada/arm_info.html). The
 org.adaic.arm_form package just provides a convenient repackaging of
 the ada-auth sources, and adds a Makefile. The Debian source package
 contains a full copy of the org.adaic.arm_form package.
