 NOTE: PDT includes a modified gfortran parser in binary form. The gfortran
 software is covered by the GNU Public License. These binaries are used by
 the gfparse script which invokes the <arch>/bin/gfortran/[cc1,f951,gfortran]
 executables. These enhancements to gfortran allow it to produce PDB files
 that contain program information for Fortran programs. We have made modified
 source available at the following webpage:

 Gfortran and the associated binaries are covered by the GPL license.
