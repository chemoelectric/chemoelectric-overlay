  Alt-Ergo is an open source automatic theorem prover dedicated to program verification.
  It is an SMT solver based on CC(X): a congruence closure algorithm parameterized by an
  equational theory X. Alt-Ergo is based on a home-made SAT-solver and implements an
  instantiation mechanism for quantified formulas.
