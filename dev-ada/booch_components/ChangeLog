  Switch back to dependency on virtual/ada, to go with providing virtual/gnat

  booch_components-20160321.ebuild:
  I am removing the virtual/ada support, because I saw it being pulled in and I
  do not want to deal with that kind of behavior, plus a set of multiple layers
  of virtuals over which I have little control.
