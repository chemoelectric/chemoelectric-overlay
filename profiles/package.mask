# Masked for testing.
# Known problems:
#   (1) Fails tests.
#   (2) mercury-extras build fails if mercury has Java grades.
# Mind you, I think some of these complaints may apply as well

# Our dev-ada/* ebuilds below are not based on gnat.eclass,

# One should have to package-unmask them to use them.

# This does not produce a useful installation,

# (which, for instance, has an outdated SRC_URI and
# has broken ‘die’ calls).
