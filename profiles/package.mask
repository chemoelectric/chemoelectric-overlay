# Masked for testing.
# Note that this will take a LONG time to build. I believe
# the *source code* interpreter is doing most of the work. If
# I go to the bother, I hope to add some dependency analysis
# to speed up the build by compiling Guile sources in a more
# correct order.
# Guile 2.2.2 comes with bootstrapping binaries for common
# platforms, and so might not take nearly as long.
