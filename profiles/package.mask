# Barry Schwartz (03 Aug 2014) Gcc is crucial to system

# I have moved my Guile live ebuilds to the ‘sortsmill’ overlay.

# This is the ebuild from portage with the dependence on eselect-cblas
# removed so it can be mixed with current ebuilds in the science
# overlay.

# Barry Schwartz (19 Dec 2011)
# Science overlay has this ebuild but with CFLAGS respected, which I
# consider a very bad idea, at least for AMD64. Unmask this to get the
# same ebuild but with the CFLAGS ignored. This version also unsets
# FFLAGS.
