# Our dev-ada/* ebuilds below are not based on gnat.eclass,
# but rather on sys-devel/gcc::chemoelectric.
# One should have to package-unmask them to use them.

# This does not produce a useful installation,
# but is closer to usefulness than is the
# dev-scheme/psyntax-r6rs-4 ebuild in the lisp overlay
# (which, for instance, has an outdated SRC_URI and
# has broken ‘die’ calls).

# Gcc is crucial to system integrity. Therefore mask my gcc ebuilds so
