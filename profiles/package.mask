# A live build of Crud Factory fontconfig, a drop-in fork of
# standard fontconfig that works around serious problems in
# fontconfig's pattern matcher and some apps that use it.
# Masked so we don't shadow the standard fontconfig's ebuild.

# Portage has an ebuild for ckermit. This one is for a live build,
# and is based on my Exherbo exheres rather than the Portage ebuild.
# (Note the the Kermit project has been cancelled and C-Kermit soon
# will be re-released as free software.)
