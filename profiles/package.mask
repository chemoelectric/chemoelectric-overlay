# Our dev-ada/* ebuilds are entirely independent of those in the
# Portage tree; they assume our own sys-devel/gcc ebuilds and the
# absence of other Ada installations. Therefore a person should
# have to make a positive effort to use our dev-ada/* ebuilds.

# This does not produce a useful installation,
# but is closer to usefulness than is the
# dev-scheme/psyntax-r6rs-4 ebuild in the lisp overlay
# (which, for instance, has an outdated SRC_URI and
# has broken ‘die’ calls).

# These are hacks for use only until the Portage tree has 14.01.
# Only the adventurous and those in need should use them.

# Gcc is crucial to system integrity. Therefore mask my gcc ebuilds so

# This is the ebuild from portage with the dependence on eselect-cblas
# removed so it can be mixed with current ebuilds in the science
# overlay.

# Science overlay has this ebuild but with CFLAGS respected, which I
# consider a very bad idea, at least for AMD64. Unmask this to get the
# same ebuild but with the CFLAGS ignored. This version also unsets
# FFLAGS.
