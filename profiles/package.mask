# ckermit fiddles with FILE internals, but fails in the attempt
# with glibc 2.28. I see no obvious fix, and later ckermit versions
# do not fix the problem. (That is unsurprising, because the latest
# version is from 2017.)
#
# Gentoo also has masked ckermit. I am masking only the version
# I have supported. However, I see an adequate fix as being
# unlikely to turn up.

# Gcc is crucial to system integrity. Therefore mask my gcc ebuilds so
# people who want them have to make a positive effort to get them.
#
# (The bug that previously caused USE=ada to fail in GCC 6.3.0 and
# 7.1.0 has been fixed, by the way.)

# This ebuild is a work in progress works, at best, only partially.
