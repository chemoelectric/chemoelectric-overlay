# Masked for testing.
# Known problems:
#   (1) Fails tests.
#   (2) mercury-extras build fails if mercury has Java grades.
# Mind you, I think some of these complaints may apply as well
# to what is in the Portage tree.

# This does not produce a useful installation,
# but is closer to usefulness than is the
# dev-scheme/psyntax-r6rs-4 ebuild in the lisp overlay
# (which, for instance, has an outdated SRC_URI and
# has broken ‘die’ calls).
