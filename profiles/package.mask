# These are unmaintained and buggy.
# Some of the code is now part of ats2libraries
# and much improved.

# Barry Schwartz (8 May 2020)
# Masked for testing.
# Note that this will take a LONG time to build. I believe
# the *source code* interpreter is doing most of the work. If
# I go to the bother, I hope to add some dependency analysis
# to speed up the build by compiling Guile sources in a more
# correct order.
# Guile 2.2.2 comes with bootstrapping binaries for common
# platforms, and so might not take nearly as long.

# The build fails, and I do not feel like fixing it, yet.

# Barry Schwartz (14 Apr 2020)
# Compiling fails, probably due to it needing work
# in the building of its Antlr parts.
