# Gcc is crucial to system integrity. Therefore mask my gcc ebuilds so
# people who want them have to make a positive effort to get them.
#
# Note that USE=ada does not work in sys-devel/gcc-6.3.0, unless you
# have a patch. There appears to be a bug in the makefiles. I would
# mask the use-flag but cannot seem to get that to work.
